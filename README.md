<h1> Label/ encoding</h1>
<br>
In label encoding in Python, we replace the categorical value with a numeric value between 0 and the number of classes minus 1. If the categorical variable value contains 5 distinct classes, we use (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4).

<h3>Limitation of label encoding</h3>
Label encoding converts the data in machine-readable form, but it assigns a unique number(starting from 0) to each class of data. This may lead to the generation of priority issues in the training of data sets.
